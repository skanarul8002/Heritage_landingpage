        <h2>About Kolkata</h2><br>
        <p>Kolkata,also known as Calcutta,the official name until 2001) is the capital of the Indian state of West
            Bengal, on the
            eastern bank of the Hooghly River 80 km (50 mi) west of the border with Bangladesh. It is the primary
            business, commercial, and financial hub of Eastern India and the main port of communication for North-East
            India.According to the 2011 Indian census, Kolkata is the seventh-most populous city in India, with a
            population of 45 lakh (4.5 million) residents within the city limits, and a population of over 1.41 crore
            (14.1 million) residents in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area. It is the third-most populous metropolitan area
            in India. In 2021, the Kolkata metropolitan area crossed 1.5 crore (15 million) registered voters. The Port
            of Kolkata is India's oldest operating port and its sole major riverine port. Kolkata is regarded as the
            cultural capital of India. Kolkata is the second largest Bengali-speaking city after Dhaka. It has the
            highest number of nobel laureates among all cities in India. <br>

            In the late 17th century, the three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal under
            Mughal suzerainty. After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690,the area
            was developed by the Company into an increasingly fortified trading post known as Fort William. Nawab Siraj
            ud-Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756, and the East India Company retook it the following year. In 1793 the
            East India Company was strong enough to abolish native rule, and assumed full sovereignty of the region.
            Under company rule and later under the British Raj, Calcutta served as the capital of British-held
            territories in India until 1911. In that year, after assessing its geographical location, combined with
            growing nationalism in Bengal (Calcutta became the centre for the Indian independence movement), the British
            moved the capital to the relatively more centrally located New Delhi. <br>

            Following independence in 1947, Kolkata, which was once the premier centre of Indian commerce, culture, and
            politics, suffered many decades of political violence and economic stagnation before it rebounded.A
            demographically diverse global city, the culture of Kolkata features idiosyncrasies that include
            distinctively close-knit neighbourhoods (paras) and freestyle conversations (adda). Kolkata is home to
            eastern India's film industry, known as Tollywood, and cultural institutions, such as the Academy of Fine
            Arts, the Victoria Memorial, the Asiatic Society, the Indian Museum, and the National Library of India.
            Among scientific institutions, Kolkata hosts the Agri Horticultural Society of India, the Geological Survey
            of India, the Botanical Survey of India, the Calcutta Mathematical Society, the Indian Science Congress
            Association, the Zoological Survey of India, the Institution of Engineers, the Anthropological Survey of
            India and the Indian Public Health Association. Four Nobel laureates and two Nobel Memorial Prize winners
            are associated with the city.Though home to major cricketing venues and franchises, Kolkata stands out
            in India for being the country's centre of association football and also having strong culture in other
            sports less widespread elsewhere.</p>

        <h2>History of Kolkata</h2><br>
        <p>Kolkata (formerly known as Calcutta) is the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal and is located in
            eastern India on the east bank of the River Bhagirathi-Hooghly (Ganga). The city was a colonial city
            developed by the East India Company and then by the British Empire. Kolkata was the capital of the British
            Indian empire until 1911, when the capital was relocated to Delhi. Kolkata grew rapidly in the 19th century
            to become the second most important city of the British Indian Empire. This was accompanied by the
            development of a culture that fused Indian philosophies with Victorian tradition. <br>

            Kolkata is also noted for its revolutionary history, ranging from the Indian to the leftist Naxalite and
            trade-union movements. Labelled the "Cultural Capital of India", "The City of Processions", "The City of
            Palaces", and the "City of Joy", Kolkata has also been home to prominent statesman and yogis. Problems
            related to rapid urbanization started to plague Kolkata from the 1653s and the city remains an example of
            the urbanization challenges of the developing nations.</p>
